![Simply Said in Action](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/148ce297-cd67-4061-9a64-06267b2d9d96)

## Motivation

Richard Feynman famously said,

> "If you want to master something, teach it. The more you teach, the better you learn. Teaching is a powerful tool to learning"

SimplySaid takes this as a core concept of it. We encourage people who want to understand complicated topics to simply teach it to everyone, reflecting a feedback and exercise your understanding. As a result, people who do not understand will understand, and people who understand will understand _more_.
